This book gathers together, for the first time, every Dior haute couture collection, including also ready-to-wear collections after the arrival of John Galliano (when ready-to-wear presentations took on a new importance), and the first two collections designed by creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri, appointed in 2016. It offers a unique opportunity to chart the development of one of the world&#39;s most famous fashion brands and discover rarely seen collections. This definitive publication opens with a concise history of the house of Dior before exploring the collections themselves, which are organized chronologically. Each new &#39;era&#39; in Dior&#39;s history is inaugurated by a brief overview and biography of the new designer, while individual collections are introduced by a short text unveiling their influences and highlights and illustrated with carefully curated catwalk images. A rich reference section, including an extensive index, concludes the book. After Chanel, Dior is the second volume in a series of high-end, cloth-bound books that offer a complete and unrivalled overview of the collections of the world&#39;s top fashion houses through original catwalk photography.<br/><br/>In order to return this item, the plastic wrap must be intact.
