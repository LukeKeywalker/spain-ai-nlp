    "This was the first model trained - no training data processing was involved except from wrapping description and names in meta markers. Model was training for 4600 steps on single GPU. Average loss at that point was 0.19. Since next iteration achieved better results with average loss of 0.35 it could mean that at this point model-1 was already overfitted, or otherwise broken. Tensorboard graph - and most probably model itself - is messed up from multiple training attempts with different training parameters. Because of that it a was throw away model to figure out whole process of training and generating answers for submission.\n",
