    "This was the first model trained - no training data processing was involved except from wrapping description and names in meta markers. Model was training for 4600 steps on single GPU. Average loss at that point was 0.19. Since next iteration achieved better results with average loss of 0.35 it could mean that at this point model-1 was already overfitted, or otherwise broken.
